# silph-users

User service for **Project Silph** â€” manages registration, authentication, and user profiles. Implements JWT-based access control and is designed for secure, standalone deployment as part of a microservice architecture. Designed as a standalone FastAPI application, silph-users is intended to be deployed independently within a microservices architecture. It communicates with other services via secure APIs and is built with future extensibility in mind â€” including support for:

- Role- and permission-based access control
- Social login integrations
- Audit logging and account recovery features
- Full localization for Filipino users

Security and modularity are top priorities â€” this service is structured to be testable, maintainable, and production-ready from the start.

## ðŸ§© Role and Purpose

`silph-users` is the **identity and authentication service** within the Project Silph microservices architecture. Its sole responsibility is to manage:

- **User identity** â€” creation, storage, and retrieval of user records
- **Authentication** â€” credential verification and JWT issuance
- **Authorization context** â€” validating and refreshing tokens, exposing user claims
- **Basic profile data** â€” usernames, emails, and optional public info

In short:  
`silph-users` owns who the user is, how they're authenticated, and what other services need to know about them.
